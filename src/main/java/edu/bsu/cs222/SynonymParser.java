    //this should be set up very similar to DefinitionParser
    //check my comments in API connection and experiment with the synonyms query request URL
        //to determine how to appropriately parse the json
    //I haven't looked at it yet, but I am assuming it will be more complex than the parsing done in DefinitionParser
        //My guess is that we will use a parseForSynonyms() method that stores an ArrayList<String> of the synonyms
            //and then the method will iterate through that list to format a String for the method to return
            //and the returned String will be used in the LearnTheDictionary class
